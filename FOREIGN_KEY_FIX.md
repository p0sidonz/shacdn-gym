# Foreign Key Relationship Fix

## Problem
The follow-up and PT components were getting errors because of missing foreign key relationships between `staff` and `profiles` tables.

## Error Message
```
{
    "code": "PGRST200",
    "details": "Searched for a foreign key relationship between 'staff' and 'profiles' using the hint 'staff_user_id_fkey' in the schema 'public', but no matches were found.",
    "hint": null,
    "message": "Could not find a relationship between 'staff' and 'profiles' in the schema cache"
}
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Schema Fix
- Added `profile_id` column to `staff` table
- Created proper foreign key relationship: `staff.profile_id -> profiles.id`
- Updated RLS policies for proper access control

### 2. Service Layer Fix
- Modified `FollowUpService` to manually fetch profile data
- Modified `PTService` to manually fetch profile data
- Removed complex joins that were causing the error
- Used `user_id` to link staff with profiles

### 3. Files Modified
- `database/final_gym_schema.sql` - Updated schema
- `database/fix_staff_profile_relationship.sql` - Migration script
- `src/services/followupService.ts` - Fixed profile fetching
- `src/services/ptService.ts` - Fixed profile fetching

## How It Works Now

1. **Staff Table**: Has both `user_id` and `profile_id` columns
2. **Profile Fetching**: Services manually fetch profile data using `user_id`
3. **No Complex Joins**: Avoids Supabase foreign key relationship issues
4. **Better Performance**: More predictable query patterns

## Migration (Optional)

If you want to apply the database migration:

```bash
node apply-staff-fix.js
```

## Testing

1. Test follow-up management - should load without errors
2. Test PT management - should load without errors
3. Verify trainer names are displayed correctly
4. Check that all CRUD operations work

## Notes

- The fix uses manual profile fetching instead of complex joins
- This approach is more reliable and avoids Supabase foreign key issues
- All existing functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to the UI components
