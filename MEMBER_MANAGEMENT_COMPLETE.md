âœ… Works with `payments` table for all financial records
âœ… Respects `refund_requests` table for proper refund workflow

### **Key Database Features Used:**
- **Membership Status Flow:** `active` â†’ `suspended` â†’ `cancelled` etc.
- **Change Tracking:** Every action recorded in `membership_changes`
- **Financial Integrity:** All payments, refunds, credits properly tracked
- **Transfer Chain:** `transferred_from_member_id` and `transferred_to_member_id`
